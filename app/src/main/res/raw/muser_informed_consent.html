	Researchers at the University of South Florida (USF) study many topics. To do this, we need the
	help of people who agree to take part in a research study. The person who is in charge of this research study is Dr. Hongdao Meng. This study is sponsored by the University of South Florida
	Strategic Investment Program

<h2>
	Purpose of the Study
</h2>
<p align="left">
	<a name="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a>
	The purpose of this study is to develop a prototype music listening application that helps
	researchers better understand the music listening behavior of family caregivers of persons
	living with dementia, including what type of music and which pieces of music were played on a
	daily basis and for how long. This data will be used to inform the design of music interventions
	for persons living with dementia to be used by caregivers.

<h2>
	<strong>How do I participate?</strong>
</h2>
<p align="left">
	If you take part in this study, your music listening information will be automatically collected
	by the MUSER Android application. You will also be asked (via email) to participate in a few
	online surveys about how and when you play music for yourself and/or your loved one. Each survey
	will take about 2 minutes to complete, and you will be asked to complete approximately 14 surveys
	over a period of two weeks (one per day). You may also be prompted occasionally to provide brief
	information about your listening (e.g., "Did you listen to music during the previous two hours?").
